# Nanoparsec's dotfiles

These are my dotfiles.

My setup so far:

- [iTerm2](#iterm2)
- [Oh my Zsh](#oh-my-zsh)
- [tmux](#tmux)
- [Ponysay](#ponysay)
- [Vim](#vim)
- [gitconfig](#gitconfig)

## Terminal setup

I prefer working in a development environement, that matches my favorite colours. Since I like purple, pink and green, I was not able to find themes that I liked. SO I had to write them by myself.

### iTerm2

[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) is a terminal replacement for Mac.

You can find my colour settings and my iTerm profile [here](https://github.com/nanoparsec/dotfiles/blob/master/iterm2_profile/)

### Oh my Zsh

I am using a standard configuration of [Oh my Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) and [Powerlevel10k theme](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k).
Find my zhs config [here](https://github.com/nanoparsec/dotfiles/blob/master/home/zshrc)

### Tmux

I like to play around with the tmux status bar. You can find my tmux config [here](https://github.com/nanoparsec/dotfiles/blob/master/home/tmux.conf)

### Ponysay

Everytime I start a new terminal window a cute little pony appears. Wanna have it, too? Look [here](https://github.com/erkin/ponysay).

### Vim

I don't use Vim that often (trying out Emacs is on my bucket list), but as you can see, I am into colors. I am using a basic confoguration of vim including rainbow paranthesis.
Find my vim config [here](https://github.com/nanoparsec/dotfiles/blob/master/home/vimrc)
CAUTION! This is a bit outdated!
